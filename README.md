# forest
Visualization of 3D scene of the forest by means OpenGL on Java ([LWJGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Java_Game_Library)).

### Stages:  
1. Modeling the scene using a package of 3D graphics - Blender;  
2. Export models suitable for parsing format - *.obj;  
3. Program parsing the exported models;  
4. Presentation of the model objects as VAO;  
5. Imposition of textures;  
6. Installation of additional configurations of the scene - the camera, the light source, the position of the model;  
7. Description of shaders;  
8. Visualization (using LWJGL).
